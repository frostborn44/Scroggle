Scroggle game search algorithms.
This program will accept a library of words to use as possible words, and then use several algorithms to search through a X by X board of space-seperated letters.
The program will generate a random board of specified size, or of default 3x3 size, and then use all the different algorithms on that board to find all of the possible words within a specified number of moves.
This project was done to explore the different algorithms and use statistics on the results using Python.
